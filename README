To use the software (in R):
1. Unpack Cpack.zip (some of the C code may need recompiling)
2. Unpack funs.zip and utils.zip, and source() these files within main R script (as done at the top of script volumetrics_fit.R)
3. File volumetrics_fit.R contains:
- the required environment (including libraries and script files);
- the main function (volumetrics()) to use to fit the regularized volumetric model of tracer uptake distribution;
- another few utility functions. 

The main function expects arguments xr, xt, and eroi, as follows:
- xr is a 5-column data frame (uptake,weigth,x1,x2,x3) in the raw coordinates
- xt is a 5-column data frame (uptake,weigth,x1,x2,x3) in the PCA coordinates
- eroi is the output of extract.roi() from package mia, which is available at https://github.com/ericwol/mia/releases/tag/1.0.4. An example of use of extract.roi():
eroi = extract.roi(xr,pcut=.25,alpha=5,nb=26,nres=25)
